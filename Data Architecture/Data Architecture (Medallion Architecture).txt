	Overview:

		The Medallion Architecture is a layered approach to data processing that enhances scalability, performance, and data quality. This project follows the 		Medallion Architecture paradigm to structure and refine the Olist e-commerce dataset using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Lake 		Gen2.

	Architecture Layers:

		The architecture is divided into three key layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each serving a distinct purpose in data transformation and processing.

	Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)

			Purpose: Store raw, unprocessed data as ingested from the source (web extraction of Olist dataset).

			Storage: Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Bronze folder)

			Processing: Data is pulled from the web and ingested into the Bronze layer using Azure Data Factory.

			Format: Parquet files to maintain schema flexibility and optimize storage.

			Key Considerations: Data remains unaltered to retain source integrity.

	Silver Layer (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

			Purpose: Apply data cleansing, transformation, and structuring to enhance usability.

			Storage: Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Silver folder)

			Processing: PySpark transformations in Azure Databricks to:

			Clean and standardize data (handle null values, fix data types, remove duplicates)

			Rename and reorganize columns for consistency

			Apply schema validation and enforce business rules

			Format: Delta tables to ensure data reliability and support ACID transactions.

			Key Considerations: Ensuring data integrity and compliance with predefined business rules.

	Gold Layer (Optimized Data for Analytics)

			Purpose: Structure data into a Star Schema to support efficient querying and analytics.

			Storage: Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Gold folder) with Delta format.

			Processing: Advanced PySpark transformations in Azure Databricks to:

			Create Fact and Dimension Tables (e.g., FactSales, DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimSeller)

			Generate Surrogate Keys for optimized joins

			Implement Aggregations for reporting and analytics

			Optimize performance using Z-Ordering and Delta Vacuuming

			Format: Delta Tables for efficient querying in Azure Synapse Analytics.

			Key Considerations: Enhancing query performance and reducing storage costs.

	Data Flow Diagram

			A high-level representation of the Medallion Architecture:

			Source (Web) → Bronze Layer (Raw) → Silver Layer (Transformed) → Gold Layer (Fact & Dimension Tables)

	Business Impact

			Improved Data Quality: Ensures accurate and structured data for analysis.

			Optimized Performance: Query performance improved via Z-Ordering and Partitioning.

			Scalability: Supports growing data volumes with structured processing.

			Enhanced Reporting: Cleaned and aggregated data enables faster and more insightful analytics in Power BI.
